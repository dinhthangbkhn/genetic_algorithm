# hill climbing

## Introduction
* find an optimal solution: optimize only neighboring points, is considered to be heuristic, belongs to the local search family
* local search algorithm: find out a solution that maximizes the criteria among candicate solutions

## Working process:
* define the current state as the state of starting or the initial state
* generalizes the solution to the current state and tries to find an optimal solution
* compare the solution which is generated to the final state also known as the goal state
* check whether the final state is achieved or not. if not achieved, it'll try to find another solution

## Type of hill climbing
* Simple Hill climbing
* Steepest-Ascent Hill climbing
* Stochastic Hill climbing
